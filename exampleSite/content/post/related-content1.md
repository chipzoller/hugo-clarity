In these demo pages, we can are showing related content.

In page 1 (this page), the related content is shown under the content region.

In page 2, we have turned off the related content in the frontmatter of the content.

We can change this per-post by setting the `showRelatedInArticle` in the front matter, or in the config files `config/_default/params.toml` (or whatever markup language your config files are using).

Likewise, the sidebar related content widget/block can be disabled by setting `showRelatedInSidebar` to false in the config files. This cannot be overridden in an individual post.
